# GlobalHealthStats-QuickSight
This visualization is based on the Global Health Statistics dataset i got from Kaggle. This dataset provides insights statistics on global health, focusing on various diseases, treatments, and outcomes. The data spans multiple countries and years.
In this project, I focus on just five diseases (COVID-19, Cancer, Diabetes, Alzheimer's and HIV/AIDS) with four different types of visualizations.
